# AI Realtor - NYC Property Prospecting System

An agentic AI system that helps identify residential apartment buildings in New York City from selected map areas, enriches building information, and automates outreach to property managers via email.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + Python Agents)
- **FastAPI** server with modular agent architecture
- **SQLite** database for building and email tracking
- **Multi-step AI pipeline** for building discovery and outreach
- **Gmail API integration** for automated email sending
- **Pluggable data sources** (mock data, real estate APIs, web scraping)

### Frontend (React + Leaflet)
- **React** with TypeScript and Material-UI
- **Leaflet maps** with drawing capabilities
- **Interactive building management** interface
- **Real-time status tracking** and notifications

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Gmail account for email automation
- OpenAI API key (recommended)

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd AI-Realtor

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template (if .env.example exists)
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
# FROM_EMAIL=your_gmail@gmail.com
# FROM_NAME=Your Name

# Initialize database
cd backend
python -c "from db.database import init_database; init_database()"

# Start the FastAPI server
python main.py
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server

## ü§ñ Agent Workflow

The system uses a multi-step AI agent pipeline:

1. **Building Discovery** (`get_buildings_from_bbox`)
   - Uses real estate APIs (Estated, Reonomy) or web scraping
   - Filters for residential apartment buildings
   - Currently uses mock data for development

2. **Building Enrichment** (`enrich_building`)
   - Adds metadata (name, units, year built, etc.)
   - Validates building type and address
   - Uses AI analysis for property insights

3. **Contact Finding** (`find_contacts`)
   - Searches web for property manager contacts
   - Extracts email addresses and names
   - Multiple search strategies with confidence scoring

4. **Email Automation** (`send_email_to_contact`)
   - Generates personalized outreach emails
   - Sends via Gmail API with OAuth2
   - Logs all email activity to database

## üìä Database Schema

### Buildings Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `name` - Building name (optional)
- `address` - Full address
- `building_type` - Type classification
- `bounding_box` - Search area coordinates
- `approved` - User approval status
- `contact_email` - Property manager email
- `contact_name` - Property manager name
- `email_sent` - Email delivery status
- `reply_received` - Response tracking
- Additional enrichment fields

### Email Logs Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `building_id` - Foreign key to buildings
- `subject` - Email subject line
- `body` - Email content
- `sent_at` - Delivery timestamp
- `status` - Delivery status
- Gmail API integration fields

## üîß Configuration

### Required API Keys

1. **OpenAI API** (Recommended)

   - Used for AI building analysis and insights

2. **Gmail API** (Required for email)
   - Set up OAuth2 in Google Cloud Console
   - Download credentials.json file
   - Place in backend directory

### Optional API Keys

3. **Estated API** (Enhanced property data)
   - Property ownership and sales history
   - Set `ESTATED_API_KEY` in .env

4. **Reonomy API** (Commercial property data)
   - Building management company info
   - Set `REONOMY_API_KEY` in .env

5. **SerpAPI** (Enhanced web search)
   - Better contact finding capabilities
   - Set `SERPAPI_API_KEY` in .env

### Gmail Setup

1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Create new project or select existing
3. Enable Gmail API

   - Verify credentials.json file is in correct location

2. **Map Not Loading**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure Leaflet CSS is properly loaded
   - Verify internet connection for map tiles

3. **API Connection Issues**
   - Check backend server is running on port 8000
   - Verify CORS settings allow frontend domain
   - Test API endpoints directly with curl or Postman

4. **Database Issues**
   - Run database initialization script
   - Check file permissions for SQLite database
   - Verify SQLAlchemy models are imported correctly
